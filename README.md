RIP Groovy (and Rhythm)

This is a bot intended the 8 Bit Music Theory discord server, since we need music bots
for our regular listening parties, where we gather to partake in submitted entries from the
weekly composition competition taking place there.

This code is a (lightly, so far) modified version of [this code](https://gist.github.com/vbe0201/ade9b80f2d3b64643d854938d40a0a2d)
by Valentin B.

## Install

Meant to work with Python 3.10

`pip install -U discord.py pynacl youtube-dl`

You also need FFmpeg in your PATH environment variable or the FFmpeg.exe binary in your bot's directory on Windows.

Might require some extra package management to get an up-to-date version of youtube-dl, for which you're on your own.
